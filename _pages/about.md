Welcome to Leigh Ann Ganzar's homepage
------
I am currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow asking the tough research questions like:
- How can we make walking and biking to school easier for kids?
- What are the social influences on physical activity and how can we leverage them to increase levels of activity?
- How can cities support active living for all?
